  - See this balding kid?
  - The quant world is difficult work, and not everyone's cut out for it.
  - We work painfully long hours, and are always on the job.
  - Its not just busy work either, we really gotta put 110% of effort into this stuff.
  - Of course, the pay is excellent, so if you think its worth it, then go for it!
  - I personally enjoy it very much!
