  - I'm supposed to be working on something right now, but I can't quite remember
    the name!
  - Here, help me out!
  - What is a scam where you get tricked into giving information over the phone?
  - Yes! That's it! You're the best!
  - If it wasn't for you, I'd probably get fired...

  - As payment for your help, take this!

  - Try again, and be careful!
  - Thanks for getting me out that pickle man!
