  - Welcome to the heart of Quantopolis!
  - Here, our professional team of quants analyze financial markets and trading strategies!
  - We pride ourselves on doing a great job with everything we do!
  - Ah, but I'm getting carried away. I know what you're here for!
  - Mr. Jogglepuff sent you to do research correct?
  - Are you willing to begin now, or will you wait and risk a loss?
  - Well, that's okay, but remember, stuff changes fast, so if you change your mind,
    hurry!
  - Perfect! To prove your skill, I'll need you to collect five machine parts by
    completing various tasks!
  - The first floor will be the main office area, the second floor will be the meeting
    room, and the last is the boss' office!
  - Good luck!
  - Have you found all the machine parts yet?
  - I see you've found all the machine parts I asked you to find!
  - Really good job, you would definitely be cut out for the quant world!
  - Here, take this Sigma badge as proof of your excellence!
  - Have a great day!
  - I often take breaks while working here, since we're so isolated.
