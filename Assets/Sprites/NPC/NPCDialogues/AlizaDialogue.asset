  - It's my first time at the hospital, and this waiting room is making me really
    nervous...
  - I'm super scared for my x-ray, those big spinning metal thingies just terrify
    me!
  - I feel like I'm gonna have a panic attack...
  - Have you ever had an x-ray?!? Do they hurt?!
  - Oh god...that doesn't make me feel any better...
  - You look really trustworthy, so I'm gonna believe you!!
  - I'm feeling better about it...deep breathes...
  - 'Oh! Theyre calling me in for the x-ray! I gotta go! '
  - Here, I found this little trinket thing in my bag earlier, no idea how it ended
    up in there.
  - I want you to have it!
  - Bye!!
  - I had the x-ray, it wasn't bad at all!!
