  - Of course the one day the servers are down, I'm the only SWE to show up...
  - Oh hey there! You surprised me!
  - I'm really stressed out right now, the boss has been on my case about fixing
    this big mess!
  - I have all the software I need, but the data breach locked me out of my computer,
    and I don't know the emergency password!
  - I'm sure someone else knows it, but I don't have the time to go find them!
  - Will you help me find the person?
  - Ugh, that's fine, but I'd really appreciate it if you did!
  - Okay, perfect! You need to talk to the people in this office, and I'm sure you'll
    be able to figure out the password through that!
  - Come back to me when you're done!
  - Have you found the password yet?
  - Oh? You've figured it out already!??
  - That was really quick of ya!
  - I'll be able to load the software onto the hard drive now, and you should be
    able to give these to the boss for him to fix everything up!
  - Here, take this hard drive!
  - Thanks so much for your help!
