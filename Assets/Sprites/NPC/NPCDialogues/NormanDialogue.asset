  dialogueLines:
  - 'Hey, my name is Norman, and I run a shop that sells all kinds of random goods
    I find on mytravels. '
  - Unfortunately, my staple items ran out of stock this week, and I forgot to order
    more!
  - Now I'm stuck with nothing to sell, and disappointed customers!
  - I asked Scott for advice, and he said I need to use something called customer
    turnover.
  - However, I'm not too sure about what it does or why its helpful.
  - So help me out. Why is monitoring customer turnover important for businesses?
  - That's not quite it, try again, you got this!
  - 'That''s right! It was on the tip of my tongue, I just couldn''t put it into
    words. '
  - By using customer turnover, I can calculate when my items will sell out, and
    when to restock my supply!
  - Thanks for reminding me about this!
  - Since I so spontaneously asked you this question, take this innovation token
    as a sign of my apology.
  - See you soon!
