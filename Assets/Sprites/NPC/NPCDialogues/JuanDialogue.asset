  dialogueLines:
  - Greetings, researcher.
  - I understand Mr. Jogglepuff has sent you from AstroLabs to conduct research.
  - You should know that him and I both went to the same university together, and
    are good friends.
  - Anyhow, I am the CEO of quantopolis, and manage everything that goes on from
    here, from floor to floor.
  - I know this place like the back of my hand, having worked my way up the corporate
    ladder to get here.
  - It was a long grind to get here, and I'm very proud of myself and my company.
  - Now, assuming you have spoken to everyone in the building before me, I have the
    last machine part you require.
  - To earn this, I need you to clear up a common misunderstanding many people have
    with the Quant world.
  - Riddle me this, newbie. What do many people mistakenly believe quant finance
    mostly involves?
  - Not quit, try again. You should know this!
  - Yes, that's correct. People seem to believe Quant is a form of gambling, and
    is high risk.
  - However, our calculations are so precise its almost never a risk for us!
  - As long as you are thorough in your work, you'll be very successful in life,
    no matter what roadblocks you may face!
  - Always remember this.
  - As promised, the last machine part you needed!
  - At least, I hope you're done!
  - Mr. Jogglepuff used to be an absolute doofus in university, but don't tell him
    I said that!
