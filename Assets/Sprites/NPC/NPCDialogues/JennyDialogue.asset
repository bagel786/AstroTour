  dialogueLines:
  - I'm here to help Dr. Stephens in case he needs any assistance, and I'm also an
    anesthesiologist.
  - Patient Sofia won't be able to speak coherently for a while, as long as shes
    under the effects of anesthesia.
  - So that leaves me to talk to!
  - I know a lot about the medical industry, and I've been involved in it for a long,
    long time!
  - Although, anyone involved in the medical industry is always involved in it for
    a while.
  - It's just so time consuming, but we do this because we love our jobs, as well
    as the pay!
  - Being in this field isn't for everyone though
  - Do you know how long it takes to become a medical doctor?
  - No, you undershot there a little bit. Try again!
  - Nope, you're overestimating it just a tad.
  - Yeah! On average, becoming a medical doctor takes around 8 years, whereas a regular
    bachelors takes around 4. It's almost double the time!
  - 'Not to discourage you from going the medical route, but it is something to keep
    in mind. '
  - Med can be really fun and exciting, but it will take a lot from you!
  - I enjoyed this conversation a lot, normally I'm always cooped up in the operating
    room and don't get to speak much...
  - Here, take this DNA Splicer!
  - You should look around other rooms!
  - I wouldn't trade the time it took for me to become a nurse for anything at all!
