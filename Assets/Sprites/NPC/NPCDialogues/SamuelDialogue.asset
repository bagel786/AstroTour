  - Greetings and salutations scientist! My name is Samuel, and I'm the head of the
    DNA research institute at the complex!
  - Right now, we're working on revolutionary technology that will allow us to alter
    DNA genes in humans.
  - Very fascinating stuff really, I could talk about it all day.
  - Unfortunately, I am swamped with work, managing all these people is really tough
    you know!
  - But the nurse at the front office told me there'd be someone here to help for
    a while!
  - I'm assuming that's you, since I've never seen you around before, and I've got
    a long memory!
  - You ready for me to put you to work pal?
  - Aw shucks! So much for being helpful...
  - Excellent! We don't have a minute to waste here!
  - You see that PC to my left? That right there is used for observing DNA Strands.
  - 'To train our ML model, we need to make sure the computer knows how to code for
    specific proteins with codons. '
  - What I need you to do is match each base pair in one strand to its complementary
    base pair!
  - It shouldn't take you too long, but it'll get your brain thinking!
  - Have fun!
  - Quick! I need this task done ASAP!
  - Whew! You finished pretty quick!
  - Seems like you did pretty good work as well!
  - Mr. Jogglepuff really did send his best researchers out here!
  - Take this as a token of my appreciation!
  - Who knows, it may be helpful for you in the future!
  - Thanks for all your help!
