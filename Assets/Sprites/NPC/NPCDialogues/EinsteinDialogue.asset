  - Hey you! Get over here!
  - Listen, I've been trying to market my new product NeuraLink HomeSync, but no
    one will pay attention to my pitch!
  - Can I pitch to you and get feedback?
  - Aw shucks, I guess I really can't market anything...
  - 'Really! Thanks! Let me get ready:'
  - The NeuroLink HomeSync is a distributed neural data network that syncs cognitive
    task lists and behavioral cues across household IoT devices using adaptive reinforcement
    algorithms.
  - That's my pitch!
  - Could you tell me what's missing or wrong with it?
  - Ugh...I don't think that's it. Try again!
  - Oh yes! That makes perfect sense!
  - I got so carried away with how exciting my new tech was, I forgot the common
    family wouldn't understand what I'm talking about...
  - Well thanks so much for your help! Here, take one of these innovation tokens!
  - Thanks a lot for your aid! I might bag some investors now!
