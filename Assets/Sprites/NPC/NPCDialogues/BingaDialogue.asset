  - In the quant biz, we use a variety of models to predict prices and other things.
  - We often use models to predict pricing of options.
  - An option is a stock contract where the consumer has the right to, but is not
    obligated, to purchase a share.
  - Could you tell me what model is used to price options?
  - 'Not quite! A binomial model simulates price movements step by step. Try again! '
  - Not quite! A Monte Carlo model uses repeated random paths to estimate values.
    Try again!
  - 'Not quite! A CAPM model predicts expected return based on market risk. Try again! '
  - Perfect! A Black-Scholes model is used to price options, although occasionally
    Binomial and Monte Carlo models are used as well.
  - I'm really impressed by your understanding of different types of models and their
    uses.
  - Even the most experienced Quants can sometimes forget about these!
  - Here, take this machine part I found lying around here.
  - It can be a cool little souvenir for your room or something!
  - Back to work for me it is!
