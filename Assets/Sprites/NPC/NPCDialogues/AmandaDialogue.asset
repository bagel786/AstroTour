  dialogueLines:
  - Hey! I'm Amanda, I'm a nurse here at the MedLab Complex!
  - I was told to keep an eye out for you, but I guess you found me first!
  - 'I''m sure the space station workers have already briefed you on what goes on
    around here, so I''ll get straight to the point. '
  - We've got a job for you, are you up for it?
  - Well, that's a bit unfortunate, we could really use a hand around here...
  - 'Awesome sauce! I''ll need you to collect 5 DNA Splicers for us. '
  - A lot of our research right now is on DNA, but we also take care of patients
    as well as do MRI research!
  - 'From the right, the rooms next to you are in order: Research lab, MRI room,
    and the operating room!'
  - Inside each room, you'll find a variety of specialists who will have little tasks
    for you to carry out!
  - Working at a hospital gets exhausting, it's nice to have someone like you take
    a burden off of us!
  - Oh! I see you've collected all the DNA Splicers I've asked you to!
  - That's really impressive, the amount of talent that Mr. Jogglepuff must see in
    you...
  - Anyways, as proof of your aid, take this Caduceus Crest!
  - It's evidence of the hard work and dedication you put into your work during your
    time here!
  - Hope to see you around, and not for any injuries!
