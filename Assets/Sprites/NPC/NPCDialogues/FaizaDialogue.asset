  dialogueLines:
  - Hi! My name is Faiza, and I run a nail business!
  - I run everything out of my house, so I'm able to control everything from the
    nail setting to design!
  - It does make me really busy though, and I'm always booked.
  - For business owners who operate out their house, marketing becomes difficult.
  - We don't have the capital for big billboards, especially as a local business.
  - What do you think the best way for me to advertise my business is?
  - Although this is a type of marketing, there is a better way for me specifically!
    Try again!
  - If you're not marketing at all, are you really a business owner...
  - Yes! That's correct, especially with technology taking over everything, you NEED
    to be using social media for your advertisements!
  - You've impressed me with your marketing skills, so take this innovation token!
  - If you know anyone who needs a nail set, hit me up!
