  dialogueLines:
  - Hey, my name's Cinder, and I'm the head of the brain research lab here!
  - 'MRIs and fMRIs are used in all sorts of research, particularly research involving
    brains. '
  - It helps us observe activity & brain structure, so that we can learn more about
    it!
  - Although if you ask me, there's a limit to how much a brain can study another
    brain to understand itself...
  - Kind of paradoxical to me, but who knows!
  - Anyways, fMRIs & MRIs have one big difference.
  - Do you know what an fMRI shows that an MRI doesn't?
  - Eh, that's not exactly it, but I see how you thought about that!
  - 'Yes, that''s it! fMRIs show current brain activity at that moment, while MRIs
    are basically photographs of the brain. '
  - Unfortunately, they do cost a lot more, so experiments using them typically have
    small sample sizes.
  - You know, you impress me with your knowledge!
  - Here, take this DNA Splicer!
  - When I go, I'm gonna donate my brain to science...
