  - Hi! My name is Jack, and I'm a cybersecurity specialist!
  - My job is to protect our servers and network from various types of attacks.
  - Unfortunately, we're currently going through a huge data attack!
  - It's way too much for me to handle, but I'm the only specialist that clocked
    in today...
  - If only somone could help me...
  - Oh i know!
  - Will you help me out?
  - Well, that's alright, but getting these systems back online will take a while...
  - Okay, perfect!
  - What kind of data attack is characterized by overloading of servers & networks
    through traffic?
  - No, a SYN flood is when an attacker floods a server with half-open TCP connections
    to exhaust resources.
  - No, a trojan is when disguised malware tricks users into installing it to steal
    or damage data.
  - 'No, a UDP attack is when an attacker floods a server with UDP packets to crash
    or slow it down.  '
  - Yes! A DDoS attack is when many machines overwhelm a target with traffic to make
    it unavailable.
  - Thanks to your help, I'll be able to fix these servers in no time!
  - Here, as thanks for my help, take this!
  - I'll be able to patch these servers up in a jiffy!
