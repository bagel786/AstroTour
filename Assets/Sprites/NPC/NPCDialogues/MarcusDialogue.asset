  - 'I sell bulk products to sellers who may use my products for their own businesses. '
  - I can turn a profit really easily, as I'm the only source of supply for most
    of these items.
  - If they have no choice of who to buy from, they have to pick me!
  - Of course, I do keep my prices fair, because even if it is a need, I can't rip
    off a customer!
