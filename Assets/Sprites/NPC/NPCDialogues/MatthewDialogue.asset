  - Hey! My name is matthew, and I'm the lead quant developer here!
  - Quants work with these things called logic gates, to perform lots of calculations
    simultataneously!
  - Since the financial markets change rapidly, we need to be able to calculate multiple
    permutations really fast!
  - There are a variety of different gates, so I'll give you details about a coupleo
    of them.
  - the AND gate returns true if both inputs are true.
  - In binary, 1 means 'on' or true, and 0 is the opposite!
  - The OR gate is similar but returns true if either of the inputs are true.
  - And there's a couple others, but they're pretty straightforward and I don't have
    the time to explain them all.
  - You ready to try it out yourself?
  - Ah, well that's okay, but its always worth a shot!
  - Awesome sauce! I need you to go to that computer and complete all the logic gates!
  - We use those for our calculations.
  - If you need help, try talking to others, they may give you some help!
  - Good luck!
  - I see you've completed all the logic gates!
  - Wasn't that fun!?
  - Anyways, good work out there. Here, take this machine part!
  - Catch ya later man!
  - I haven't seen my family in 5 years...
